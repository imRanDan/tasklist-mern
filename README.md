# myTaskList
A full-stack web app where users can create an account, login, and create time-stamped tasks for the day/week/month! User data is encryped with JWT and bcrypt

**Link to project:** https://mytasklist.cyclic.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** MongoDB - Expressjs - Reactjs - Nodejs - Redux - HTML5 - CSS3 - JavaScript - bcrypt - JWT

I started with the back-end and getting the functionalities to work. I used JWT and bcrypt to help encrypt user data in the middleware, and used a MVC model to structure the rest of the back-end. I used Reactjs and Redux on the front-end to practice what I've learned and to make sure it looks great.

## Optimizations

I did not have time to make a homepage/landing page but if I were to come back to refactor/add more I would do this.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a lot about on how to connect the front-end and back-end to get a true fullstack app to function. I learned alot about how to encrypt user data so that they don't have to worry about their info getting exposed. Playing around with Redux DevTools and React components was also great hands-on experience of breaking and fixing things.
